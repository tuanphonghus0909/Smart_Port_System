    <p>UI Base</p>
    <p>This is the foundational element for a Dashboard in Node-RED Dashboard 2.0</p>
    <p>A Dashboard is driven by a baseline layout which can be modified with some of the following settings</p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>
            Sidebar Style
            <span class="property-type">option</span>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Collapsing: </b>(default) This open will shift the entire content of the Dashboard when opened, and not be visisble at all when closed.</li>
                <li><b>Fixed: </b>Will always remain open. At our mobile breakdpoint (768px), this value is overriden, and an "Appear Over" option is used.</li>
                <li><b>Collapse to icons: </b>Similar to "Collapsing" when opened, but when closed, the icons for each page still show.</li>
                <li><b>Appear over content: </b>Not visible when closed, and when open, will appear over the Dashboard content, without shifting it.</li>
                <li><b>Always hide: </b>The sidebar will not be visible under any circumstances. All pages are still accesible via their direct links or a <code>ui-control</code> node.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dt>
        App Icon
        <span class="property-type">URL</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        You can provide a custom URL for your application's icon, which will be displayed as the app icon and in the browser tab.
    </dd>
